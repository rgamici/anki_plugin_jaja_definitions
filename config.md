If you want to use different field names, edit the following variables:
(**You need to restart Anki for the changes take effect**).

* **"expressionField"**: (default: "Japanese") This is the field that has the Japanese word that will be searched in weblio.

* **"jap_defField"**: (default: "JapaneseExpression") This field will receive the fetched definition from weblio.

Other variables: 
(No need to restart)

* **"max_threads"**: (default: 15) The number of words that will be fetched simultaneously from weblio.
  A very high number (50) can trigger weblio's DDoS protection and result in no results.
